# 🧪 JSX Practice Assignment

Welcome to your **JSX Practice Assignment**!  
This project contains **10 mini challenges** to help you master the core rules and patterns of JSX.

Each test focuses on a different key concept of writing clean, correct JSX code.

---

## 🚀 How To Start

> **Important**: The below commands will only work in a **Unix-based terminal** (like Git Bash, WSL, or MacOS Terminal). So if you're using **Windows Command Prompt**, please switch to Git Bash. If you are on a Mac or Linux, you can use your default terminal.

## 1. Clone the Original Repository

First, **clone** the original assignment repo onto your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Konadu-Akwasi-Akuoko/React-Assignment-01-Jomacs.git
```

This will create a new folder named **`React-Assignment-01-Jomacs`**.

---

## 2. Move Into the Project Directory

```bash
cd React-Assignment-01-Jomacs
```

---

## 3. Delete the Existing `.git` Folder

This will **completely remove** the original Git history and connections:

```bash
rm -r .git
```

> ⚡ Important: Double-check that you are inside the correct project folder before running this!

---

## 4. Create a New Repository on GitHub

- Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new).
- **Create a new repository** (give it a name like `React-Assignment-01-Jomacs-YourName`).
- **Do NOT** initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or License. (Leave them unchecked.)

---

## 5. Initialize a New Git Repo Locally

Now inside your project folder (React-Assignment-01-Jomacs), start a **new Git**:

```bash
git init
```

---

## 6. Add All the Files

```bash
git add .
```

This stages everything for your first commit.

---

## 7. Make Your First Commit

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit for my React JSX Assignment"
```

---

## 8. Connect Your Local Project to Your New GitHub Repo

Now link your local project to the new GitHub repository you just created, using the green Code button on your GitHub repo to copy the HTTPS link. After that add the remote origin:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/YourNewRepoName.git
```

---

## 9. Push Your Code to GitHub

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

> If you get an error because the branch is named `master` instead of `main`, you can rename it:

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 🎯 After Doing This

You now have your **own clean version** of the assignment — ready to work on and submit!
